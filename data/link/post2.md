I knew my sword was good for something. Why not earn a little extra money while on my very time sensitive adventure. No real rush tho. I hope Zelda has a few good books she can read.

Who knew these things swords could be so heavy? I bet I could take on Ganon already, I'm just sharpening it on this grass and Octoroks. I got em all running scared.
