Good morning. I'm off on an adventure to rescue the Princess. I'll bring my sword because, it's dangerous to go into caves alone, and my sword counts as people.

Someone gave me this map. I should keep it on me, like in the upper right-hand corner. Hyrule looks gigantic. I bet they'll have me mowing lawns for a while.
