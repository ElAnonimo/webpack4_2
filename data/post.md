# Villa de Leyva

Villa de Leyva is a Colombian town northeast of Bogotá. It’s known for its whitewashed colonial buildings, cobbled lanes and vast Plaza Mayor. On that square are the early 17th-century Our Lady of the Rosary church and the House of the First Congress of the United Provinces, where new laws were drafted after independence in 1812. Southwest of the plaza is the Antonio Nariño House Museum, where this war hero died.
