Okay this is getting to be a bore. This lock is watching me. I'm sure of it. Perhaps Link will find me, perhaps not, but if I can just turn these hand cuffs into a sword, with my magic, I can make enough noise to get the guards to open the lock for me.

Ah ha! I've done it. Magic's working again. Tri-force must be near. Okay, now to make all the noise in the world. These guards have no idea what kind of Princess they're dealing with.
