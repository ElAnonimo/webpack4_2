It sucks in here. I'm trapped in Ganon's stinky old prison. The tri-force is just out of range. I can't feel it from here. I'll need to devise an escape plan. Something ingeniously magical.

I'm sure I'll think of something clever, but until then, I'm going to think of my true love... Hyrule. I do hope she's doing okay out there. That someone brave is keeping her grass cut. The end.
